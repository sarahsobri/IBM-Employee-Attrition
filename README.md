# IBM Employee Attrition
#### Many businesses are beginning to benefit from the use of cutting-edge technology, where data management and analysis are proving to be a strategic advantage in terms of effectiveness and market competitiveness. Artificial intelligence is beginning to affect organization decisions regarding their employees, based on the evaluation of objective data rather than subjective considerations, as it becomes more widely adopted in the sales and marketing sectors (Gupta, Fernandes and Jain, 2018). Finding dedicated staff is difficult for any organization, but finding replacements is even more challenging. Not only does this increase HR costs, but it also lowers the company's market worth. In this study, we used SAS Enterprise Miner (EM) to analyze the IBM Employee Attribution dataset of 1470 records to identify the primary reasons why employees quit a company by identifying top attributes that significantly led to attrition.
